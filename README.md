In this project, I describe how to automatically block unwanted calls using a whitelist with FreePBX and HT813. All numbers not stored in the whitelist are blocked, thus avoiding spam and telemarketing calls. This method is particularly useful if you don't use the phone for work and receive many unwanted calls from constantly changing numbers.
If you prefer a different strategy, with a few modifications you can configure a blacklist, blocking only problematic numbers. Additionally, to avoid missing important calls, you can activate voicemail for rejected calls.
FreePBX and VoIP offer many features, so this guide is just a starting point. I hope you will contribute with comments and suggestions to improve the system.

I would love to hear your suggestions and modifications! Feel free to leave comments, make pull requests, or contribute in any other way to improve this guide.
If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me through GitHub channels.
